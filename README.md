## Why Avoid Destructuring Multiple Properties from useStoreCart

When using Zustand (or similar state management libraries), destructuring multiple properties from a store like this:

```ts
const { addProduct, products, addProduct } = useStoreCart();
```

causes the component to subscribe to the entire store object. This means **any change in the store** (even if unrelated to the property you care about) will trigger a re-render of your component. For example, if `addProduct` changes its reference, it will force a re-render, even if `products` did not change. This is especially problematic for components like FlatList, which rely on stable references to avoid unnecessary re-renders of their items.

### Example of the Problem

Suppose you have:

```ts
const { addProduct, products } = useStoreCart();
```

Every time `addProduct` changes (e.g., due to a new function reference), the component re-renders, causing FlatList to re-render all its items, even if `products` did not change. This leads to performance issues and a poor user experience.

### Recommended Approach: Select State Slices Individually

Instead, select only the state you need:

```ts
const getProducts = useStoreCart(state => state.getProducts);
const products = useStoreCart(state => state.products);
const addProduct = useStoreCart(state => state.addProduct);
```

This way, your component only re-renders when the specific slice of state changes. For example, if `products` changes, only the relevant part of your component updates. If `addProduct` changes, it does not affect the rendering of the product list.

#### Example from `ProductScreen.tsx`

```ts
const getProducts = useStoreCart(state => state.getProducts);
const products = useStoreCart(state => state.products);
const addProduct = useStoreCart(state => state.addProduct);
```

This pattern ensures that FlatList only re-renders when `products` changes, not when unrelated store properties change.

### Alternative: Use Memoized Components

If you cannot change the destructuring pattern, you can use memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. For example, in your project, you use `ProductItemMemo`:

```ts
<ProductItemMemo item={item} onAdd={addProduct} />
```

Memoized components like `ProductItemMemo` help avoid re-rendering individual items unless their props actually change.

## Summary
- **Destructuring multiple properties from the store** causes your component to re-render on any store change.
- **Selecting state slices individually** ensures your component only re-renders when the relevant state changes.
- **Memoized components** (like `ProductItemMemo`) can help mitigate unnecessary re-renders if you cannot change the destructuring pattern.

Use these patterns to improve performance and avoid unnecessary UI updates in your React Native screens.
